# IDEAS

Here's a code review with suggested improvements:

1. **DOM Element References**
   - Current: Elements are queried and stored in `elements` object at initialization
   - Suggestion: Add error handling for missing elements and lazy loading for elements only when needed
   - Benefits:
     - Faster initial load
     - More robust error handling
     - Reduced memory usage for unused screens
   - Disadvantages:
     - Slightly more complex code
     - Small performance overhead when first accessing elements

2. **Event Handler Consolidation**
   - Current: Many onclick handlers directly in HTML
   - Suggestion: Move to centralized event delegation in JavaScript
   - Benefits:
     - Better performance (fewer event listeners)
     - Easier maintenance
     - Better memory management
   - Disadvantages:
     - Initial refactoring effort
     - Slightly more complex event handling logic

3. **State Management**
   - Current: State spread across multiple managers (doc, flashcards, etc.)
   - Suggestion: Implement a central state manager with clear state transitions
   - Benefits:
     - Easier debugging
     - More predictable behavior
     - Better state synchronization
   - Disadvantages:
     - Significant refactoring needed
     - Learning curve for new pattern

4. **Error Handling Strategy**
   - Current: Mix of alerts and console logs
   - Suggestion: Implement consistent error handling with user-friendly notifications
   - Benefits:
     - Better user experience
     - Easier debugging
     - More professional feel
   - Disadvantages:
     - Additional code complexity
     - Need to design and implement notification system

5. **Memory Management Enhancement**
   - Current: Basic cleanup in flashcardsManager
   - Suggestion: Implement WeakMap/WeakSet for caching and reference management
   - Benefits:
     - Better garbage collection
     - Reduced memory leaks
     - More efficient long-term usage
   - Disadvantages:
     - More complex implementation
     - Needs careful testing

6. **Code Organization**
   - Current: Large manager objects with multiple responsibilities
   - Suggestion: Split into smaller, focused modules with clear interfaces
   - Benefits:
     - Better maintainability
     - Easier testing
     - Better code reuse
   - Disadvantages:
     - Need to set up proper module system
     - Initial refactoring effort

7. **Constants and Configuration**
   - Current: Some hardcoded values in code
   - Suggestion: Move all constants to configuration objects
   - Benefits:
     - Easier maintenance
     - Better configurability
     - Clearer code intent
   - Disadvantages:
     - Additional configuration management needed

8. **Performance Optimization**
   - Current: Some operations might be redundant
   - Suggestion: Add memoization for expensive operations and debouncing for frequent events
   - Benefits:
     - Better performance
     - Reduced CPU usage
     - Smoother user experience
   - Disadvantages:
     - Additional complexity
     - Need to carefully choose what to optimize

9. **Type Safety**
   - Current: Pure JavaScript without type checking
   - Suggestion: Add TypeScript or JSDoc type annotations
   - Benefits:
     - Catch errors earlier
     - Better IDE support
     - Easier maintenance
   - Disadvantages:
     - Learning curve
     - Build process needed
     - Initial setup effort

10. **Testing Infrastructure**
    - Current: No visible testing setup
    - Suggestion: Add unit tests and integration tests
    - Benefits:
      - Catch bugs earlier
      - Safer refactoring
      - Better documentation
    - Disadvantages:
      - Significant initial effort
      - Ongoing maintenance
      - Need to set up testing infrastructure

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these suggestions or proceed with implementing specific improvements?

Here are several areas where we can improve the code:

- Consistency in Code Style:
  - Some functions use var, others use let/const
  - Inconsistent naming conventions (camelCase vs PascalCase)
  - Inconsistent spacing and indentation
- Redundant Code:
  - RemoveSpaces function is defined twice
  - Some functions could be combined or simplified
- Event Listeners Organization:
  - Event listeners are scattered and some are commented out
  - Could be organized better
- Modern JavaScript Features:
  - Using old XMLHttpRequest instead of fetch
  - Could use more modern ES6+ features

Break this into several steps.

- you can give me, based on my code base, some recommendations what to change to better align with modern screen-based vanilla js app aproach

-----

lze udelat to, ze pwa spa vanilla js aplikace si bude cashovat poslední "virtuální screen" a jeho přesný stav tak, ze kdyz se vratim do aplikace zpet pouzitim seznamu spuštěných aplikaci, uvidim presne to, co tam bylo pred přepnutím do jiné aplikace.
